# Case Study 2# SQL BurgerBash

# Case Introdution

I have a started a new business of selling burger because I read on my Instagram
feed that „Burger Is the Future!

But I knew that burger alone was not going to help me get seed funding to expand
my new Burger Empire - so I had one more genius idea to combine with it - I was
going to Uberize it - and so Burger Runner was launched!

I started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh burger from Burger Runner
Headquarters and also maxed out my credit card to pay freelance developers to
build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

In this Case I make fluxogram In dbdiagram.io.

I make data scripts In MYSQL for create table e insert data to use function in SQL.
